As an owner of a beer company, I want to be able and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my supercomputer. I want to be able to organize my business and plan it out better.


Creating a command-line application that accepts user input. When I start the application I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role.

When  I choose to view all departments, then I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids. Then I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role. When I choose to view all employees, then I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to. When I choose to add a department. Then I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database. When I choose to add a role.When I choose to add an employee. Then I am prompted to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database
When I choose to update an employee role, then I am prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database.
